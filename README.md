### About me

Senior developer with five years of experience and a focus on .Net. Managed to work at Promsvyazbank (PSB) and moved to Ozon Tech. Was a speaker at meetups from Ozon and DotNetRu Community, was able to try on the role of an expert at the company's stands at Dotnext and E-code. 

Launched educational programs "School of Digital Roles" at PSB and Route256 at Ozon. Was both a teacher and a mentor. Helped companies hire students, and students pass interviews at companies. I love networking. 

Golang and Rust enjoy. A programming language is a tool, and the world does not end with C# alone for me.
