### About me

Senior Developer with five years of experience specializing in .NET. I have worked at Promsvyazbank (PSB) and transitioned to Ozon Tech. I have been a speaker at meetups hosted by Ozon and the DotNetRu Community, and I had the opportunity to serve as an expert at company booths during conferences like Dotnext and E-code.

I launched educational programs such as the "School of Digital Roles" at PSB and Route256 at Ozon, where I took on roles as both an instructor and a mentor. I supported companies in hiring students and guided students through the interview process. Networking is my passion.

Golang and Rust enthusiast. I see programming languages as tools, and my world is not limited to C# alone.
